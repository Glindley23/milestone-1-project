GRAIL JUMP
# milestone-1-project
Browser-based Game

This is my very first attempt at a 2D platformer game using only vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS.

Basic Controls:

A,D,W keys for left, right, and jump

Only one level right now, jump across the platforms to try and reach the golden grail at the end.

This was my first attempt at incorporating modals as well as animation loops for side scrolling terrain and character models.
